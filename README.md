## Detecting Citizen Problems and Their Locations Using Twitter Data -  Idea 2

  - This Project focuses on the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data.
  - Analyzing the collected data to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem.
  - Detecting tweets, which have any city problem
  - Two datasets were created consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. 
  - Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. 
  - A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely.

## Nutrition Oriented Online Recipe Recommender  -  Idea 3

 -  Recommend recipes according to ingredients present already  
 - ML model to recommend recipes according to nutritional values.
 - Algorithm which utilizes machine-learning techniques such as neural networks and matrix factorization in order to model the interactions between ingredients and     their proportions within recipes for the purpose of offering suitable recommendations
